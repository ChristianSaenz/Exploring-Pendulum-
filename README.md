# Exploring Pendulum Dynamics: From Simplicity to Chaos

This repository contains the implementation of numerical methods used to explore the dynamic behavior of pendulum systems. The project investigates a range of phenomena, from simple harmonic motion to complex, chaotic dynamics influenced by non-linear, driven, and damped conditions. 

## Methods Included
The code in this repository covers the following models:

- **Simple Pendulum Dynamics**: Simulations of motion under small-angle approximations.
- **Nonlinear Systems**: Handling larger angular displacements to capture realistic pendulum behavior.
- **Damped Motion**: Introducing energy loss through damping factors like air resistance or friction.
- **Driven Motion**: Adding external driving forces to explore resonance and chaotic behaviors.
- **Coupled Pendulums**: Simulating synchronized and anti-phase oscillations in systems of two or more connected pendulums.

## Key Applications
These methods can be used to understand and simulate:
- Real-world systems such as clocks, sensors, and earthquake-resistant structures.
- The transition from predictable to chaotic dynamics under varying initial conditions and parameters.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python**: For implementing and running numerical simulations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the results of pendulum dynamics.
- **Euler-Cromer Method**: To numerically solve differential equations governing pendulum motion.
