# Exploring Pendulum Dynamics: From Simplicity to Chaos

This project investigates the dynamic behavior of pendulum systems, ranging from simple harmonic motion to complex, chaotic dynamics influenced by non-linear, driven, and damped conditions. Using numerical simulations and models such as the Euler-Cromer method, I explored various factors including:

- **Simple Pendulum Dynamics**: Analyzing motion under small-angle approximations.
- **Nonlinear Systems**: Examining the impact of larger angular displacements.
- **Damped and Driven Forces**: Investigating energy loss and external driving effects.
- **Coupled Pendulums**: Exploring synchronized and anti-phase oscillations.

## Key Findings
The results reveal how small changes in initial conditions or parameters can transition a predictable system into a chaotic one. This research has practical applications in designing real-world systems such as clocks, sensors, and earthquake-resistant structures.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python**: For numerical simulations.
- **Matplotlib**: To visualize dynamic behaviors.
- **Euler-Cromer Method**: For differential equation modeling.
